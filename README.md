## Abstract
NanoRibolyzer is an Epi2Me compatible tool to analyse ribosomal RNA biogenesis pathway at single nucleotide resolution. 
Nanoribolyzer aligns reads to the human RNA45SN1 of hg38. A template based read association approach allows for quantification of known ribosomal intermediates.
Several template free clustering approaches can are integrated to detect and study unknown ribosomal RNA intermediates. 
In addition to the template association NanoRibolyzer performs polyA tail estimation, finds abundant cut sites, extracts 5' terminal base sequences for motif analysis 
and detects the relativa abundance of specific RNA modifications. Outputs of NanoRibolyzer can be used to disect specific subpopulations of ribosomal RNA reads and asses characteristic properties   
on a single nucleotide resolution level.
